Project Overview:

This project consists of the following components:

Data collection and preprocessing: Collecting and cleaning the sepsis dataset, and preparing it for machine learning.
Feature engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming the data to improve model performance.
Model training and evaluation: Training a machine learning model on the sepsis dataset, and evaluating its performance.
Deployment on Hugging Face: Deploying the model on the Hugging Face platform, making it easily accessible for healthcare professionals.
Prerequisites:
To work on this project, you'll need:

A computer with Python installed (version 3.6 or higher)
An account on the Hugging Face platform
Familiarity with machine learning concepts, natural language processing (NLP), and Python programming
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The sepsis dataset used in this project is publicly available on [URL]. To preprocess the data, follow the steps outlined in the preprocessing.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

Feature Engineering:
After preprocessing the data, select relevant features and engineer new features using techniques such as text tokenization, word embedding, and feature selection. The feature engineering steps are described in the feature_engineering.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data, using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The model training and evaluation process is documented in the model_training.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

Deployment on Hugging Face:
Deploy the trained model on the Hugging Face platform, making it easily accessible for healthcare professionals. To deploy the model, follow the steps outlined in the deployment.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

We hope you find this project useful and inspiring. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project team.

Happy coding!!
